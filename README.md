# **NBA Data Analytics**

I’ve always believed the NBA is one of the richest sources of data in sports; every game produces a stream of information that, if captured and interpreted well, can reveal trends that aren’t obvious from traditional box scores. This project is my attempt to build a real analytics pipeline using Python, SQL, and Tableau to turn raw NBA data into meaningful insights and predictive tools.

This is an ongoing project I worked on with my good friend Conner Khudaverdyan, which will evolve as I add new features and build out deeper analytical capabilities. 

** Current Focus **

Right now, I’m building scripts to:

- Fetch daily NBA box scores automatically

- Store game data in an organized format for future analysis

- Begin exploring trends in scoring, efficiency, and player performance

- Create visual dashboards using tools like Tableau


** Planned Features **

As the project develops, I will be adding:

- Shot location and scoring breakdowns

- Team efficiency metrics and strength-of-schedule analysis

- Predictive tools for player performance and game outcomes

- Machine learning models for forecasting

My long-term goal is to develop a repeatable analytics pipeline that updates in real-time as the season progresses.

** Tools and Technologies **

- Python: data collection, cleaning, and automation

- SQL: structured data storage and querying

- Tableau: visual analytics and dashboard creation

** Follow the Project **

I will be sharing insights, visualizations, and analytics breakdowns from this project on Instagram:
