This repository is where I’m building a Python, SQL, and Tableau-based toolkit for collecting, analyzing, and visualizing NBA data. The goal of this project is to automate the full workflow—from pulling live and historical stats using the nba_api library, to cleaning and storing the data, to building insights and predictive models over time.

This is an ongoing project I worked on with my good friend Conner Khudaverdyan, which will evolve as I add new features and build out deeper analytical capabilities. 

Current Focus

Right now, I’m building scripts to:

- Fetch daily NBA box scores automatically

- Store game data in an organized format for future analysis

- Begin exploring trends in scoring, efficiency, and player performance

- Create visual dashboards using tools like Tableau


Planned Features

As the project develops, I will be adding:

- Shot location and scoring breakdowns

- Team efficiency metrics and strength-of-schedule analysis

- Predictive tools for player performance and game outcomes

- Machine learning models for forecasting

My long-term goal is to develop a repeatable analytics pipeline that updates in real-time as the season progresses.

Tools and Technologies:

- Python for collecting and cleaning data
- SQL for the database and storing of data
- Tableau for data visualizations
